Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher, advised by Dagmar Iber in the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at the ETH Zürich. I am writing software for microscopy analysis in support of the lab’s goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms that underpin morphogenesis. Additionally, I am a core developer of [napari](https://www.napari.org).

Previously, I was an R&D engineer in the Bioengineering platform at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. At the Biohub, I built hardware and software tools to make novel measurements on biological systems. In particular, I led the development of the in situ transcriptomics platform.

Outside of the lab, you can find me skiing and climbing.
